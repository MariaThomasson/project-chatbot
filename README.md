 Project Name
Project ChatBot (TravelBot)

Jessica Hermansson & Maria Thomasson
This week we are building a ChatBot in pairs using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
Some of the learnings this week:
- Be comfortable using variables
- Know some string methods to modify strings
- Understand control flow and the use of conditionals statements
- Be able to write basic functions which take arguments and return values
- Connect the JavaScript to show visual feedback in the HTML

## The problem
We got stuck with having our bot to pick up multiple variables and get them in right order 
to get the right respons as a user. We asked questions on Stack Owerflow and got help 
from a former alumni to get the bot to pick up the variables and nicely answer where you 
should travel from the aswers the user choosed.
